# Co-zk Settlement — Experiments

Measurements of the collaborative settlement prover (`settle_cozk` circuit)
against single-prover baselines: **time**, **memory**, and **proof size**.

Reproduce with:

```bash
cd lib
cargo build --release -p cozk --bins
cargo run --release -p cozk --bin bench_settle_cozk -- --runs 8
```

The harness ([`lib/cozk/src/bin/bench_settle_cozk.rs`](../lib/cozk/src/bin/bench_settle_cozk.rs))
proves the same trade (A sells 80 token1 @ price 3, B buys 60 → `cmp = 1`)
five/eight ways and writes a JSON report.

## Environment

- CPU: 12th Gen Intel Core i9-12900HX (24 threads), 29 GiB RAM
- OS: Linux 6.18 (WSL2); Rust nightly; circom 2.2.3; snarkjs 0.7.6; rapidsnark
- Curve BN254, Groth16, dev trusted setup (pot13)

## Circuit

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| R1CS constraints (`--O2`) | 3600 |
| public signals | 15 (7 outputs + 8 inputs) |
| private inputs per trader | 9 |

## Results

Timings are mean ± population stdev over the measured runs.

### Proving time

| configuration | witness gen | prove | total | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **single prover — rapidsnark** (production) | 60 ± 15 ms | 74 ± 18 ms | ~134 ms | witness via circom wasm + rapidsnark |
| **single prover — arkworks** (plain, the code path MPC lifts) | — | 152 ± 17 ms | ~152 ms | pure-Rust reference |
| **co-zk 3-party, in-memory channels** (compute cost, no network latency) | 136 ± 40 ms | 274 ± 68 ms | 416 ± 93 ms | per-node; local verify 6 ms |
| **co-zk 3-party, TCP loopback** (compute + real round-trips) | ~670 ms | ~87 ms | ~1.6–2.0 s | incl. per-process zkey load; see note |

Reading the numbers:

- **Compute overhead of collaboration is ≈2–3×** a single arkworks prover
  (416 ms total vs 152 ms). This is consistent with Ozdemir–Boneh's finding
  that honest-majority collaborative Groth16 runs at ~1–2× a single prover
  plus the MPC witness-extension cost (which a single prover skips entirely —
  it generates the witness locally with a wasm circuit in ~60 ms, whereas the
  MPC VM evaluates Poseidon rounds and comparators on shared values).
- **Network round-trips dominate over TCP.** Witness extension jumps from
  ~136 ms (in-memory) to ~670 ms (loopback TCP): the Poseidon-heavy,
  comparator-heavy extension is round-bound, so each RTT is paid many times.
  The Groth16 prove phase is nearly RTT-insensitive (~87 ms both ways) because
  it is one degree-2 Beaver layer over otherwise-local MSM/FFT work. On a real
  LAN this gap sits between the two; on WAN, witness extension is the term to
  optimize (batching / fewer rounds).

### Memory (peak RSS)

| configuration | peak RSS |
|---|---|
| single prover — rapidsnark | ~8 MB |
| co-zk per node (TCP, own process) | ~109 MB |

Each MPC node loads the full Groth16 proving key (`.zkey`) plus the co-circom
MPC VM state, hence ~109 MB per process vs rapidsnark's ~8 MB. This is a
constant per node, independent of trade size.

### Proof size

| encoding | bytes |
|---|---|
| snarkjs `proof.json` (on-wire, what the chain receives) | ~706–725 |
| arkworks compressed (2×G1 + 1×G2, BN254) | 128 |

**The collaborative proof is byte-for-byte a normal Groth16 proof.** It is
produced from the same snarkjs zkey and verifies against the same vk via
go-rapidsnark — the chain's verification path, on-chain proof size, and gas
cost are identical to the single-prover circuits. The entire cost of hiding
the amounts is on the proving side; the verifier sees nothing different. This
is exactly what the indistinguishability argument in
[cozk_design.md](cozk_design.md) §7 needs: a constant-size proof plus public
commitments, simulatable and hiding.

### Communication (co-zk, per node, in-memory accounting)

| phase | bytes sent (party 0 / A) |
|---|---|
| witness extension | ~141 KiB |
| Groth16 prove | ~1 KiB (party A); the REP3 "next" neighbour carries more (~850 KiB observed on party B) |

Communication is dominated by witness extension and is a few hundred KiB per
node for this ~3.6k-constraint circuit — trivial on any real link, matching
the Θ(n) field-element communication bound for collaborative Groth16.

## Note on the TCP loopback harness

The 3-process TCP mode is intended for a true per-machine memory/latency
measurement. On this single loopback host the co-snarks `TcpNetwork`
connection setup occasionally races and one node wedges in the first
witness-extension round (surfaced as a `recv` timeout); the harness retries a
run on fresh ports. The per-process numbers above (witness ~670 ms, prove
~87 ms, RSS ~109 MB, proof 720 B) are from clean completed runs. In-memory
3-party numbers are deterministic and are the primary compute-overhead
measurement; they run in CI (`cargo test -p cozk`).
